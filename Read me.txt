#This is a django application for fetching data from the restAPI 'pokeapi'.

#This app can be used to fetch basic info about a pokemon such as it's name, description and image
by entering the name of the pokemon in the input field on the homepage and submit.

#Pokeapi have wrappers for different languages including a wrapper for 'python with auto caching'
that can be easily used to consume data from the api by just importing a library. I however took
a different approach. 

#I used the standard method for comsuming data from any RESTAPI,
that works well in most cases.

#For this to work,

  1. Create a virtual environment using conda distribution
  2. conda install python == 3.6.4
  3. pip install django == 2.0.5
  4. pip install requests
  5. pip install json
  
#In views.py , a function named query_pokeapi is used to consume json data from the api source using by requesting the api
for data using requests.get(url) and then loading it in json. The view named pokeview is used to call the function query_pokeapi
and pass parameter to it . The argument to be passed comes from the form using get method. Then we convert json string into native python object and render the data to the template 'pokedex.html'
