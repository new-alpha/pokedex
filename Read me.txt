#This is a django application for fetching data from the restAPI 'pokeapi'.

#This app can be used to fetch basic info about a pokemon such as it's name, description and image
by entering the name of the pokemon in the input field on the homepage and submit.

#Pokeapi have wrappers for different languages including a wrapper for 'python with auto caching'
that can be easily used to consume data from the api by just importing a library. I however took
a different approach. 

#I used the standard method for comsuming data from any RESTAPI,
that works well in most cases.

#For this to work,
